   # get_throttled

   #      Returns the throttled state of the system. This is a bit
   #      pattern - a bit being set indicates the following meanings:

   #      Bit   Meaning
   #      ────  ────────────────────────────────────
   #       0    Under-voltage detected
   #       1    Arm frequency capped
   #       2    Currently throttled
   #       3    Soft temperature limit active
   #      16    Under-voltage has occurred
   #      17    Arm frequency capping has occurred
   #      18    Throttling has occurred
   #      19    Soft temperature limit has occurred

   #      A value of zero indicates that none of the above conditions
   #      is true.
